# Computer Vision Projects
1. Fashion item classification
2. Handwriting recognition from scratch and using pre-trained models
3. Feature matching using ORB,SIFT keypoint descriptor and Brute force,Flann based matcher
4. Image segmentation using Watershed algorithm
5. Instance segmentation using MASK R-CNN


All the Deep learning models are implemented in Keras library backed by Tensorflow
